    <p>Formed in 1964, ITC has been the focal point within the United Nations system for trade related technical assistance (TRTA). In line with our joint
       mandate from the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the United Nations through the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), we 
       Support our parent organizationsâ€™ regulatory, research and policy strategies. We focus on implementing and delivering practical TRTA projects.</p>
